## Developing

Activate Docker Compose

- open a terminal in the root directory where the docker compose file is.
- run the command :

```
docker compose up -d --build
```

Runs the docker compose in detached mode and is always running.  
So when finish developing for the day do NOT forget to `down` everything.  
To shut it down when need to, use the command:

```
docker compose down
```

Create entry points in `webpack.common.js` for example: About

```
"site/about": [
      path.resolve(__dirname, "../src/site/js/about.js"),
      path.resolve(__dirname, "../src/site/scss/about.scss"),
      path.resolve(__dirname, "../src/site/views/about.phtml"),
    ],
```

Create the 3 about files in the `src` directory

```
/src/site/js/about.js
/src/site/scss/about.scss
/src/site/views/about.phtml
```

Create The `About.php` Controller, just copy, paste and rename the Home Controller

Run Webpack

```
npm start
```

or

```
npm run watch
```

Open your favourite browser and go to localhost:9580 and refresh 'F5'.  
 Sorry no hot reloading.
